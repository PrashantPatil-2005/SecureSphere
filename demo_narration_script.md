# SecuriSphere — Demo Narration Script (60–90 seconds)

> **Purpose**: Ready-to-speak script for the viva/project demo. Read this while clicking through each tab on the Streamlit dashboard.

---

## Opening (10 seconds)

> "This is **SecuriSphere** — a B2B multi-layer cybersecurity monitoring system that I built. What makes it different from just running three separate security scanners is the **correlation engine** — it automatically connects alerts from different modules and tells you what's actually happening."

---

## Tab 1: Overview Dashboard (10 seconds)

> "Here on the Overview, you can see the real-time metrics — **active incidents, risk score, total alerts, and compliance score**. The risk gauge gives an instant visual. Below it, the **Live Threat Map** shows the top critical incidents detected right now."

---

## Tab 2: Network Timeline (10 seconds)

> "The Network Timeline shows our **baseline traffic in green** versus detected anomalies in **red**. You can see how the connection count spikes far above normal during a brute-force attack. The vertical lines mark when high-severity events occurred."

---

## Tab 3: Password Compliance (10 seconds)

> "This tab runs a **password policy audit**. The gauge shows the overall compliance score, and below it you can see the specific violations — things like passwords that are too short or missing special characters. The pie chart breaks it down by severity."

---

## Tab 4: API Vulnerabilities (10 seconds)

> "Here we scan for **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities. Each row shows the affected endpoint, the category like Broken Authentication or BOLA, and the severity. You can filter by severity and see the bar chart for a quick summary."

---

## Tab 5: Correlated Incidents ⭐ — THE KEY TAB (20 seconds)

> "Now, this is the **most important tab**. Watch what happens when I toggle the **Before vs After** view. On the left, you see scattered medium-severity alerts across three different modules. On the right, the correlation engine has grouped them into a **single critical incident** with a full threat story — it tells you *exactly* what happened, why it's critical, and what to do about it."

> "Each incident card shows the **severity badge**, the **explanation**, a **timeline of linked alerts**, and **recommended actions**. This is the core value — **turning noise into actionable intelligence**."

---

## Tab 6: Risk Prioritization (5 seconds)

> "Finally, the Risk Prioritization tab ranks all assets by risk score with heatmap coloring, so you know exactly where to focus first."

---

## Sidebar Demo (10 seconds)

> "Let me show the simulation. I'll select '**Multi-Stage Attack**' and click **Launch**."
> *(click the button)*
> "The backend just received five attack alerts. The correlation engine ran automatically, and the dashboard refreshed — you can see the new incident appear in real-time. I can also export incidents as **CSV** or generate a **PDF report** for compliance."

---

## Closing (5 seconds)

> "In summary, SecuriSphere takes three independent security tools and unifies them with a correlation layer that **automatically escalates, prioritizes, and explains threats** — saving analysts hours of manual triage. Thank you."
